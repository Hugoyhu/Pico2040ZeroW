This is an UNTESTED design, based off the Raspberry Pi RP2040 chipset.

Please look over source files prior to fabrication.

Board is designed with KiCAD, a FOSS PCB and Schematic EDA.

All files are designed in the latest stable version(5.1.9 as of time of writing)

Schematic is modified off the Raspberry Pi foundation's reference schematic and carrier demo board schematics with modifications. 

Outline and location of parts were placed with the assistance of Chromico's Raspberry Pi pHAT Screw Terminal shield: https://github.com/Chromico/Raspberry-Pi-Screw-Terminal-Shield

This is a modified design from Pico2040ZeroW/Hardware with different layout and more efficiency(possibly).
